# macOCR

macOCR is a command line app that enables you to turn any text on your screen into text on your clipboard.
When you envoke the `ocr` command, a "screen capture" like cursor is shown. 
Any text within the bounds will be converted to text. 

You could invoke the app using the likes of [Alfred.app](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/), Quicksilver etc.

If you're still wondering "how does this work ?", I always find the .gif is the best way to clarify things:
